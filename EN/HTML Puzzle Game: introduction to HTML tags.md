* Equipment:
    * Printed cubes: you will find the templates [here](../Ressource/CubeHTML.pdf) and [here](../Ressource/CubeHTML2.pdf).  
    Follow these instructions to build the cubes: [HTML Puzzle Box](https://yopdesign.makes.org/thimble/LTQ5ODQ2NjU2MA==/html-puzzle-box).
    * If you wish to modify the cubes templates, you can download the SVG files [here](../Ressource/CubeHTML.svg) and [here](../Ressource/CubeHTML2.svg).

## Key notions
* What is a HTML tag?
* What do these HTML tags mean?
* The basic structure of a HTML page.
* Participants code their very first HTML page on their own.

## Sequences

### Part 1: HTML cubes, code with Thimble and code with a text editor

#### HTML cubes
1. Spread the cubes on the table.
2. Explain the difference between the structure of the page (build with the HTML language) and the content (text and images). Start by introducing the different types of cubes:
   * The opening tags
   * The closing tags
   * The single tags
   * he cubes with content
3. Explain the meaning of some tags:
   * `<head>` and `<title>`
   * `<body>` and the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<img>` tags
4. With HTML cubes and content cubes: start to build a basic structure with a `<h1>` title and a paragraph. Then add more `<h1>` big titles or `<h2>` small titles, place some paragraphs with these titles and add images.

#### Code and play with Mozilla Thimble
1. Go to Mozilla Thimble web page (you will need internet connection).
2. Select a project and modify the HTML code (and the CSS if you wish).

#### Code with a text editor
1. Open a text editor (Notepad++, Text Edit).
2. Start to code: write the basic HTML structure and add content between the HTML tags (take content from a WIkipedia page for example).

**Note:** if you don't have internet connexion, prepare a folder with text and images.

### Part 2: CSS (optional, depending on the workshop duration)
* Explain what CSS means.
* You can select a web page and desactivate the CSS.
* Talk about inline CSS written between the `<head></head>` tags, and imported CSS external file.
* Add somme CSS to the HTML structure, for example:
   * Modify the color and the size of a title and a paragraph
   * Add a colored background
   * Center the text and then align right

## Variant
For advanced participants: organize a challenge between small groups, make them create a customized web page.
