##Rules of the game
Participants collect clues and look for a mysterious person.
Start the workshop: each participant pick the profile of the Internet User they have to discover.
The game ends when a participant has discovered the target Internet User.

__The game set:__

* “Action” cards placed on the table: ordinary actions we do when bronwsing the Internet (e.g. connect to a social network).
* “Protection” cards (content side is hidden): security tools to protect one's private data (for one or several actions).
* “Profile” and “Target” cards: each participant knows her/his Internet User profile and the Internet User she/he has to discover
* “Information” cards: tracks left by the Internet Users profile.

__The game:__

1. The first participant select another participant and launch an chosen action against her/him. The “Action” cards show the tracks we leave on the Internet, and the difficulty to discover this track (from 1 to 5). Participants will choose different “Action” cards.
2. The participant throws the dice: if the result is equal or higher than the difficulty level (from 1 to 5), the participant wins the clue:
    * if the result is 6: the participant wins a “Protection” card that she/he can use later
    * if the target participant has a “Protection” card: she/he can use it and protect the clue
3. And so on.
4. At any time, a participant can guess another participant's profile, but if she/he is right the game ends, otherwise she/he vas to leave the game.
5. According to the duration of the game, the organiser can ask every participant to guess other participant's profile; the participants announce their profile.
